# Random Photo

This is my first app to learn how to create apps using swift language.

## What does the app do?

Every time you press the button to randomize a photo,
a new photo and a random background color are shown.

<div style='margin-top: 50px'>
<center>
    <img src='./screenshots/screenshot1.png' alt='App appearance' width='200'>
    <img src='./screenshots/screenshot2.png' alt='App appearance' width='200'>
    <img src='./screenshots/screenshot3.png' alt='App appearance' width='200'>
</center>
</div>
